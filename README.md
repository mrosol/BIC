# BIC
University project on doctoral studies for Biology Inspired Computations.
The aim of the project is to design and instantiate two deep network architectures that can be used for
recognition of the predefined objects in images. The used dataset can be found here: http://chaladze.com/l5/

This repository contains files in which the performance of the ResNet50-based network in this particular classification task is examined.
